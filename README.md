# React iPhone photo gallery

What do kids these days like? Apps and Justin Bieber, of course!

This demo uses [ReactHack](http://github.com/petehunt/ReactHack) to build a high-performance, lazy-loading 3d intertial photo touch gallery targeted at the iPhone 5. It really shows off what web technologies can do these days.

## Software being used

  * [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/) for the sweet Justin Bieber content
  * [React](http://github.com/facebook/react) JS library (so easy to use, and performance is great without even trying!)
  * [Zynga Scroller](http://github.com/zynga/scroller) for touch gesture physics (not in repo)
