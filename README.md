# React Hackathon toolkit

This repo combines a few open-source tools (React, Bootstrap, Backbone and Browserify)
into a performant and easy way to build apps.

## Getting started

Make sure you have [npm](http://npmjs.org/).

1. Clone this repo
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser

## Future work

- Requirable CSS and images per CommonJS asset spec
- Multiple browserify bundles
- Full-page rendering
- Server rendering
- Testing integration
- Use require() for React and Parse and other APIs
- All Bootstrap-specific React components (specifically grids)
